/*
    This is the payment provider. It is a "mock" of an external service that you can pretend runs on another system.
    With this API you can ask customers to pay an invoice.

    This mock will succeed if the customer has enough money in their balance,
    however the documentation lays out scenarios in which paying an invoice could fail.
